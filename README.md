## Angular CLI Project Initialization

This guide will walk you through the process of initializing an Angular CLI project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## Getting Started


### Step 1: Open your command-line interface (CLI) or terminal.

### Step 2: Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Angular project.

### Step 3: Install Angular CLI globally by running the following command:
### Step 4: Once the installation is complete, create a new Angular project by running the following command:
ng new my-project
Replace `my-project` with the desired name for your project.

### Step 5: You will be prompted to choose various options for the project, such as whether to include routing and which stylesheet format to use. Make your selections based on your requirements.

### Step 6: After the project is created, navigate into the project directory:
cd my-project


### Step 7: To serve the project locally and view it in your browser, run the following command:
ng serve

This will start the development server and provide you with a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4200`) where you can access your project.

Congratulations! You have successfully initialized your Angular CLI project.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
